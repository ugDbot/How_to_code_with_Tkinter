To make any python file an exe you'll have to:
pip install pyinstaller
duplicate your project an rename it your choice e.g "exe"
open the duplicate project with pycharm and open the terminal
ensure to change the directories in your code to the new directory where the duplicate file is saved if any

in the terminal type in: pyinstaller.exe --onefile --noconsole --icon="the icon name" main.py

--onefile means it makes the exe one file
--noconsole means it stops pyinstaller from opening a background console
--icon means the icon image (ensure its in the same folder as your project)
main.py means the name of your "code file".py
finish!
